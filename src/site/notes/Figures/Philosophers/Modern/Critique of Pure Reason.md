[Critique of Pure Reason](https://www.amazon.com/Critique-Pure-Reason-Immanuel-Kant/dp/0486415854)

## Highlight

-   "Critique of Pure Reason" is a foundational work of modern philosophy that explores the nature of knowledge, reason, and the limits of human understanding.

## Review

-   In this treatise, Kant argues that the human mind imposes structure and categories onto the raw sensory data it receives from the world, and that our knowledge of the world is therefore limited by these structures. He also contends that there are certain fundamental principles of reason, such as causality, that are necessary for understanding the world but cannot be proven or derived from experience.

-   People interested in learning about the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and his ideas about the nature of knowledge and reason.
-   Those interested in exploring themes such as the limits of human understanding, the role of the mind in shaping our experience of the world, and the foundations of knowledge and reason.
