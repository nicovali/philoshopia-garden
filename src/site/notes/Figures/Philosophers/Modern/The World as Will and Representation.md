By Arthur Schopenhauer

[The World as Will and Representation](https://www.amazon.com/World-Will-Representation-Volumes-1/dp/0486457008)

## Highlight

-   "The World as Will and Representation" is a comprehensive examination of the nature of reality and the human experience of the world.

## Review

-   In this treatise, Schopenhauer argues that the fundamental nature of the world is not matter, but rather a primal force or will that drives all things. He also contends that the human experience of the world is mediated through our senses and our individual representations of it, and that suffering and dissatisfaction arise from our desire to change or control the world.
